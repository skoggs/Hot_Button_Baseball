Player Card Sheets,All of the important information about the player cards. Also why I made this sheet!
Card #,This is the collector's number of the given player.
Starter,"""y"", short for yes, indicates the card can be found in the starter set i.e. it is MUCH easier to find than other cards."
Rat,"Short for Hot Rating, the player's rating given on the player's card. Highest is 98, lowest is 60. Has a strong correlation coefficient of 0.65 with WAR/Wins Above Replacement."
Spd,"""*"" indicates that the card has Speed. Having 5 cards on your roster with Speed gives a currently unknown bonus."
Def,"""*"" indicates that the card has Defense. Having 5 cards on your roster with Defense gives a currently unknown bonus."
WAR,"This is an estimate of a player's WAR/Wins Above Replacement with an assumption of 600 PA/Plate Appearances, 900 BF/Batters Faced, and an average of 2 WAR for cards in the player pool."
IRL WAR,"This is a players offensive fWAR or pitcher's fWAR in the 2004 season, adjusted to  600 PA or 900 BF. (fWar being Fangraphs WAR)"
DIFF,This is the difference between my calculated WAR and IRL WAR.
Special,This is the player's special ability. 
Success %,This is the player's chance of success based on their printed card values. Note that stolen base % has a blanket 50% boost.
1-10,These are the printed player outcomes for the player's non-special outcomes.
R1-10,These are the effects of run values multiplied by the chance of that outcome happening. Summing these values together is a core part of estimating player WAR.
BWAR,This is a version of estimated WAR without special abilities factored in.
SWAR,This is the adjustment to a player's WAR when special abilities are included. Note that players will have a negative adjustment if they have a weak ability.
OBP,This is a player's on base percentage when not using their special ability. This is necessary for calculating the potency of the stolen base abilities.
,
Odds,A sheet for estimating how the Hot Button Baseball lights work probabalistically.
#,"This is the corresponding light on the Hot Button Baseball Machine, from top to bottom, where top is the most common."
Hits,How many times the light lit up in my 500 trials.
Std,An estimated standard deviation of the number of hits.
Percentage,The percentage of the time the light lit up in my 500 trials.
Std%,The estimated standard deviation of the number of hits converted to percentage form.
Estimated Odds/256,"These are the estimated values where a given light would activate with a 256 number (two hexadecimal) random number generator, which is the probable calculation method."
Est256%,These are the numbers out of 256 converted to a percentage.
,
Linear Weights,
These are the run values for various baseball outcomes. Used to calculate run expectancy of player cards.,
There is also a column included for calculating on base percentage.,
,
Starter Deck Draft,
An example 2-player draft of the 20 starter deck cards. The contents of the decks were modified slightly to make them more evenly matched. (Lance Berkman is OP.),

Fangraphs Sheets,
